ACST3060 Quantitative Risk Analysis Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment applied quantitative risk modelling to financial portfolios using Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and backtesting. Focused on risk metric computation, model validation, and quantitative analysis.

## Key Tasks
- Calculated VaR and Expected Shortfall at various confidence levels  
- Conducted backtesting for risk model validation  
- Analysed risk-return profiles and quantitative implications  

## Skills Demonstrated
- VaR and Expected Shortfall modelling  
- Backtesting and quantitative validation  
- Risk metric computation and portfolio analysis  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all VaR/ES calculations, backtesting results, plots, and quantitative conclusions.)
